# Python-Challenge

In this Challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. Observing the data collected in budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

    The total number of months included in the dataset

    The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

    The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

    The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


For the second tasks I was to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. I am to analyze the poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 

My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

    The total number of votes cast

    A complete list of candidates who received votes

    The percentage of votes each candidate won

    The total number of votes each candidate won

    The winner of the election based on popular vote
